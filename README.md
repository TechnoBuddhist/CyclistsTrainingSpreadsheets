All spreadsheets have a README worksheet, this readme is a general overview.

## Limitations

Currently in the AnnualTrainingPlanTemplate -> WeeklySchedule tab - it doesn't automatically calculate the correct hrs for all of the different types of Workout Selections.

E.g.  If you select Base 1 Rest: S4---S3-- the planned hrs is 0 for the S4 workout and 1 and 2hrs for Tue/Wed where there are no planned workouts.

Use the auto generated planned hrs as a guide and tweak to your needs until I re-read the Cyclists Training Bible and fix the spreadsheet.
